Command ifwr(1) proxies a command and fails if it writes to stdout or stderr.
ifwr(1) execs a command and notes if it writes to stdout or stderr.
If the command completes successfully but wrote to stdout and ifwr(1) was given the -1 flag, it fails.
If the command completes successfully but wrote to stderr and ifwr(1) was given the -2 flag, it fails.
The output to stdout and stderr is still written and the program is run to completion.
